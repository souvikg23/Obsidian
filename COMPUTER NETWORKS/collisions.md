**Data Packets Collision:** When two or more devices transmit their data packets at the same time on the same network segment, these packets interfere with each other. The data in these packets becomes garbled and loses its integrity, making the packets unreadable at the receiving end.

**Effects of Collisions**: Collisions result in the loss of the transmitted data, requiring those packets to be retransmitted. This can lead to network inefficiency, increased latency, and reduced overall network performance, especially in networks with high traffic.
