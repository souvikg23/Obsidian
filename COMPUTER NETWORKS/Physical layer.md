- #review 
- **Physical layer defines the mechanical and electrical specifications of the medium**
		- **Physical Characteristics of Interfaces and Medium**
		- **Representation of bits**
			- Physical Layer Data = Uninterpreted Stream of Bits
			- Bits must be Encoded into Signal
			- signal transmission : electrical ,waves, lights
		- **Data Rate/bit rate**
			- Number of bits sent each second
		- **Synchronization of Bits**
			- Sender and Receiver must be synchronized at Bit levels
			- two micro processor Cycles 
				- fetch cycle
				- IR cycle
			- 
		- [[Line Configuration]]
		- [[Physical Topology]] 
		- [[Transmission Mode]]
